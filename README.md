# IsaaClone

A little clone of [Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/) for the only purpose of learning game dev, c# and Monogame libraries.

The game is identical to Binding of Isaac in the mechanic but it's a little different, IsaaClone it's a survival game, where you have to kill all the waves of BUSINESS MAN with the help of various power-ups!

The Player and Enemies sprites are made with [DALL-E](https://openai.com/)
